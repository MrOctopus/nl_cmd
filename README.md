# nl_cmd

NL_CMD is an advanced papyrus framework created for the purpose of supporting the addition of new console commands to Skyrim SSE. From day one it was designed with accessibility in mind, providing easy-to-use functions to simplify console - papyrus communication. Registering and unregistering new commands is almost as easy as registering for plain old, vanilla papyrus events, and argument parsing is built-in from the get-go.

Notably the mod has no additional dependencies besides SKSE and should always be compatible with every game version that SKSE supports. 

## Main Features

* Actual support for new console commands
* In-game help documentation
    - Supports individual command descriptions
* Argument parsing support
    - Supports all the basic types: bool, int float, form, string
    - Parsing is done automatically, all you need to do is define the callback types!
* Built-in SendModEvent functionality
    - Ever wanted to send mod events directly from the console? Now you can.

    - Clear the console
    - Print to console
    - Execute native console commands
    - Get the last console command
    - Get the current console selection
    - All without any .dll dependencies!
